// Rhapsody's Performance Config - 9/13/14
// Launch options stated here. Copy these into TF2's launch options, and remove -dxlevel 90 after the first launch,
// or else your graphics settings will keep reverting if you modify them.
// Fullscreen: -dxlevel 90 -full -w WIDTH -h HEIGHT -console -novid -useforcedmparms -noforcemaccel -noforcemspd
// Windowed:   -dxlevel 90 -sw -w WIDTH -h HEIGHT -console -noborder -novid -useforcedmparms -noforcemaccel -noforcemspd
// Don't use -dxlevel 95 with this config. I've attempted to, but for some reason, whenever you exit the graphics options with -dxlevel 95 enabled, it defaults back to -dxlevel 90 or even -dxlevel 80.
// I'll look into this in the future.

mat_vsync 0 	 // Turn off vsync to avoid nasty I/O latency.
r_fastzreject -1 // Values >1 enable a fast Z rejection algorithm, to be performed on the GPU (as opposed to on the CPU). The value `-1' autodetects hardware support for this feature, which is safer than forcing it.
