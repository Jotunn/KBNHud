-Go to "^customizations/#colors" and open "ccolors_clientscheme.res" with a text editor program (eg. Notepad, Notepad++ works best though) and there should be a large heading saying "COLOR CUSTOMIZATION SECTION," having a online RGB sampler site is recommended.
-Under that are a bunch of groups of color options. Each name will have an RGBA value on the same line. 
-Pick the color you want from the sampler site. If you want to change the "Ammo in Clip" value, which changes the color of the ammo counter from white "235 235 235 255" to red, change the value to "255 0 0 255"
-The fourth number in the color value is the A in RGBA, short for alpha. In English, this is the transparency. 255 makes anything using the color opaque, less than that causes those items to be translucent. 0 is fully transparent.
-NOTE: The RGB numbers for “Low Health flash 2” and “Low Health flash 3” should always be made the same. If you change the value for "Low Health flash 2" to "204 204 0 255," then you must change the value for "Low health flash 3" to "204 204 0 75," leaving the transparency values as 255 and 75 respectively.
